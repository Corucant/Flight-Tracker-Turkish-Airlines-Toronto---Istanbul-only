# Turkish Airlines Flight Tracker (Toronto - Istanbul only)

This is a personal project that automatically tracks Turkish Airlines flight prices between Toronto and Istanbul and sends email alerts when the price drops below a specified threshold.

The bot uses Selenium to interact with the Turkish Airlines website and extract pricing data in real time.

## Current Status

At the moment, it has limitations when dealing with dynamic content or JavaScript-rendered icons on the website. These issues will be addressed in future updates. Suggestions for improvements are welcome.
